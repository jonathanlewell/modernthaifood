## One of the easiest starters to make in only 30 minutes

If you’re looking for one of the easiest starters to make, here’s an idea: prawns, cooked on top of thin bread together with a delicious paste, all topped with sesame seeds and served with a sweet chilli sauce.

- Thai name: "Khanom bang na kung"
- Preparation time: 30 minutes
- Cooking time: 30 minutes
- Makes: 10-12 fish cakes
- Serve as a starter

## Ingredients

- 5-6 slices thin white bread
- 280 g (10 oz) ground (or minced) raw shrimp (prawns)
- 3-4 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped
- 2-3 coriander roots & stalks, cleaned, roughly chopped
- ¼ tsp ground white pepper
- ½ tsp salt
- 1 large fresh egg
- 6 tbsps sesame seeds
- Sunflower oil for deep-frying

## Let's get started!

1) Slice and remove the crusts from the bread. Cut the bread into two triangles, lay them on the tray and leave them outside without covering on the night before cooking.

2) Using a pestle and mortar, pound garlic, coriander roots and stalks into a paste.

3) Mix minced prawns with the garlic and coriander paste, ground white pepper, salt and egg together in a bowl and set aside.

4) Spread the prawn paste thickly on one side of a piece of dried bread. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and press on firmly. Repeat with the remaining prawn paste and bread.

5) Heat 5 cm (2 inches) oil in a deep frying pan or wok over a medium heat. Drop a small piece of bread into it. If it sizzles immediately, the oil is ready. Deep-fry a few pieces at a time, paste-side down, for 3-4 minutes or until golden. Turn them and lightly brown the bread side. Lift out with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Repeat and deep-fry the remaining.

6) Serve crispy sesame prawns on toast hot or warm with sweet chilli sauce. (See recipe below!)

## How to make your own Thai sweet chilli sauce

Nothing lifts the taste of a starter like crispy sesame prawns on toast (or spring rolls) quite like Thai sweet chilli sauce. It's sweet and not too spicy, like the name might suggest.

You can make it in advance. It keeps well in the fridge for 3-4 days.

- 3 fresh red chillies about 13 cm (5 inches) long, stemmed, de-seeded and roughly chopped
- 100 ml (3½ fl oz) white vinegar (about 6 tbsps)
- 55 g (2 oz) caster sugar (about 4 tbsps)
- ¼ tsp salt

1) Before pan-frying the fish cakes, make the sweet chilli sauce, as follows. Pound or finely chop the red chillies. Boil the vinegar, sugar and salt in a small saucepan up to boiling point, stirring constantly.

2) Reduce the heat and simmer for 8-10 minutes or until the mixture forms a thick syrup. Spoon in the chillies and cook for 2-3 minutes, then pour into a serving bowl.
