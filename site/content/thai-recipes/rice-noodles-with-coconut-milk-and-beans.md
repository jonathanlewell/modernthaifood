## "Mii kra ti kup tou"

This dish is rich and a little spicy, using stir-fried “sen mii” (very thin) noodles with coconut milk. You’ll find it straightforward to prepare and cook the dried beans. You can use a mixture, as I suggest, of chick peas, pinto beans, butter beans, cannellini beans, and red kidney beans, or select just your favourite kind.

- Preparation time: 20 minutes
- Soaking time: (dried beans) overnight; (noodles) according to manufacturer's instructions
- Cooking time: 2 hrs 15 mins, inc. beans or: 15 minutes if using ready-to-eat beans
- Serves: 4 as a main dish

## Healthy tip!

According to U.S. scientists, if you eat beans four times per week you reduce your risk of heart disease by 22% (in comparison to those who eat them only once a week).
Let's get started!

## Cooking instructions

1. Soak the mixed beans in water overnight. Drain and place them in a saucepan of boiling water and boil vigorously for 15 minutes. Drain and replace the water and bring up to boiling point, turn the heat to low and simmer for 1½ hours or until they are tender, drain. Check and replenish the water if necessary. This boiling and soaking will making them easier to digest. (If you are using ready-to-eat mixed beans, skip this step).

Before soaking, dried mixed beans (above) look like beads or jewels. Wonderful colours!

2. If you are using dried chillies, soak them in boiling hot water for 4-5 minutes or until soft, then drain.

3. Using a pestle and mortar grind or pound the chilli you are using (dried & soaked, or fresh) and shallots into a paste. Or: finely chop both of them.

4. In a small bowl soak the tamarind pulp with the boiling water for 4-5 minutes. Mash with a spoon or fork to help it dissolve. Then strain the thick liquid into a small bowl and reserve the fibres in another bowl. These are useful if you need to strain the liquid again.

5. Soak the noodles in boiling water (or according to the manufacturer’s instructions) until they start to get tender but not completely soft. Drain, add in a bowl of water to make them cool down, then drain again. (If the noodles are completely soft they will easily break up during stir-frying.) If you’d prefer to have the convenience of ready cooked noodles you can use them straight from the packet.

6. Heat the oil in a nonstick frying pan or wok on a medium heat. Pour in the egg and swirl the pan so that the egg coats it, forming a thin omelette. Cook for 2 minutes or until the egg is set and slightly brown on the underside, then flip over to brown the other side. Remove from the pan, allow to cool, then roll up and cut into thin strips.

Rolling up and cutting the omelette into thin strips (step 6).

7. Heat the coconut milk, chilli and shallot paste, mashed salted soybeans, sugar, 1½ tablespoons light soy sauce and 2 tablespoons tamarind purée, lime or lemon juice in the same pan or wok, stir and mix until the sugar has dissolved.

8. Add the noodles, mixed beans, pickled garlic, half of the bean sprouts and spring onions and gently toss for 3-4 minutes or until the noodles have warmed through. Stir in the omelette, taste and adjust the seasoning, using the rest of the light soy sauce, tamarind purée, and the lime or lemon juice if necessary. It should have four flavours: a little spicy, sweet, salty and sour, altogether in one dish.

The whole dish before serving.

9. Spoon the noodles into each serving bowl. Garnish with a few coriander leaves. Place the remaining bean sprouts at the side of the bowls.
