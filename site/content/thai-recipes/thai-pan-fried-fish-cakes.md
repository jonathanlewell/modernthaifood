## Fish cakes are just one of many delicious snacks sold as street food in Thailand.

Batches are fried on request and served in a plastic bag along with a bamboo skewer to hold them while eating. You can take them home together with a small bag of sauce for additional flavour.

## Ingredients

### Main Dish

- 450 g (1 lb) minced (ground) white fish fillet such as monkfish, cod, haddock or coley
- 1 tbsp fish sauce
- 2 tbsps self-raising flour
- 1 large fresh egg
- 55 g (2 oz)green beans, finely sliced
- 3-4 kaffir lime leaves, finely shredded
- sunflower oil for pan-frying

### Curry Paste

- 2-3 dried red chillies about 13 cm (5 inches) long or: 2-3 fresh long red chillies, stemmed, de-seeded and roughly chopped
- 13 cm (5 inches) fresh lemon grass, finely sliced
- 2.5 cm (1 inch) fresh galangal, peeled and finely sliced
- 3-4 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped
- 3 coriander roots and stalks, cleaned and roughly chopped or: 1 tbsp packet of red curry paste, depending on how hot you like it
- 2 shallots, peeled and roughly chopped

## Let's get started!

1. If you are using dried chillies soak them in boiling hot water for 4-5 minutes or until soft, then drain.

2. Using a pestle and mortar or small blender pound or blend the chillies you have chosen (dried & soaked, or fresh), the lemon grass, galangal, garlic, shallots and coriander roots until the mixture forms a paste. Or finely chop all the curry paste ingredients if you have no suitable equipment. It will still taste good!

3. In a bowl, combine the minced fish, curry paste, fish sauce, flour, egg, green beans and kaffir lime leaves together.

4. Heat a little oil in a nonstick frying pan. Use your wet hands or spoon to shape the fish mixture into thin, flat cakes, 2.5-5 cm (1-2 inches) across, making sure there is a slight gap between each one. Gently fry on a low-medium heat. Fry for 3-4 minutes each side or until cooked and lightly browned.

5. Add a little oil in the pan before cooking each batch. Add the cucumber and mix in with the sweet chilli sauce. Sprinkle the roasted peanuts over it and serve with the fish cakes.

If you make more fish cakes than you need they will keep well in the refrigerator for 3-4 days, and you can easily reheat them in a warm oven for 8-10 minutes. Alternatively, keep them uncooked in the freezer, then unfreeze and pan-fry them.

Healthy Tip: A good source of omega-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids, fish should be on everyone’s menu at least one a week, according to most nutritionists. Coriander is a member of the carrot family, but only Thai cuisine uses the roots as a flavouring. Coriander has a calming effect on the stomach.

## Want to add your own Sweet Chilli Sauce?

Try it with Peanuts and Cucumber﻿﻿﻿﻿. You can make it in advance. It keeps well in the fridge for 3-4 days.

- 3 fresh red chillies about 13 cm (5 inches) long, stemmed, de-seeded and roughly chopped
- 100 ml (3½ fl oz) white vinegar (about 6 tbsps)
- 55 g (2 oz) caster sugar (about 4 tbsps)
- ¼ tsp salt
- 25 g (1 oz) roasted peanuts, roughly chopped
- 2.5 cm (1 inch) cucumber, quartered and finely sliced

1. Before pan-frying the fish cakes, make the sweet chilli sauce, as follows. Pound or finely chop the red chillies. Boil the vinegar, sugar and salt in a small saucepan up to boiling point, stirring constantly.

2. Reduce the heat and simmer for 8-10 minutes or until the mixture forms a thick syrup. Spoon in the chillies and cook for 2-3 minutes, then pour into a serving bowl. Add the cucumber and peanuts just before serving the main dish.
