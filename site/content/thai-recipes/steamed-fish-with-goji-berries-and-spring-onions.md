You will find goji berries in many of my recipes. I have cooked with them for years, long before they became popular as a so-called “superfood.” Here they form a particularly important part of the dish, along with spring onions and ginger. They add amazing nutritional value, not to mention a welcome touch of colour.

## The Amazing Health Benefits!

As well as their many other health benefits, spring onions are thought to be more beneficial than other onions in curing sinus infections. They have been used for this purpose in the Far East for centuries. Their nutrients include carbohydrates, proteins and fats, together with minerals such as phosphorous, zinc and potassium.

Goji berries are rich in antioxidants, particularly carotenoids such as beta-carotene and zeaxanthin. By protecting the retina at the blue end of the spectrum, zeaxanthin helps to decrease the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD) of the eyes.

Ginger (below) is one of the best herbs for digestion, while also improving and stimulating the circulation of blood throughout the body. It relieves nausea and lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol.

## Ingredients

### Main Dish

- 900 g (2 lb) 2 sea trout, pomfret, mackerel, sea bass or grey mulletor: 225 g (8 oz) 4 fish fillets such as skinned cod, haddock, sea bass or salmon, fine bones removed cleaned and dry
- 2 tbsps oyster sauce
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 2 tbsps light soy sauce
- 2.5 cm (1 inch) fresh ginger, peeled and finely shredded
- 10 whole spring onions, cut into 2.5 cm (1 inch) pieces diagonally
- 40 sundried tibetan goji (wolf) berries

### Garnish

- a few fresh coriander leaves
- a few slices of fresh red chilli

## Let's get started!

1. Clean and scale the fish (if necessary) and gut them, but in each case you can leave the head on or remove it, whichever you prefer. Score each fish three or four times, not quite through to the bone, on both sides with a sharp knife. Dry them well with kitchen paper.

2. Place the fish on a deep heatproof plate large enough to take them. (The plate needs to be able to fit inside the steamer or bamboo steamer basket.) Rub all the fish with oyster sauce and sesame oil. Drizzle over with the light soy sauce and sprinkle on top with the ginger, spring onions and goji berries.

  Or: place the fish (or nestle the fish fillets side by side) on a large square piece of foil. Rub and sprinkle as above, then loosely seal the foil to make a parcel, making sure you leave space at the top for the steam to circulate while the fish are cooking. Place the parcel inside the steamer or basket.

3. Fill a steamer pan or wok with water, cover and bring to boiling. Carefully place the steamer or basket on top of the steamer pan or wok. Cover and steam for 15-20 minutes (depending on the variety and size of the fish) or 10-15 minutes for fish fillets. The fish are cooked when a skewer will slide easily into the flesh and come out clean. Check the water underneath and top up with boiling water if necessary.

4. Remove the fish from the steamer and place them on to a warm serving plate. Garnish with coriander leaves and chilli.
