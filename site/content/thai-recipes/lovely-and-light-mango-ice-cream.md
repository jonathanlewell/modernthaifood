## "Ice cream mamuang"

{{< figure src="/img/mango-ice-cream.jpg" alt="Lovely and Light Thai Mango Ice Cream" >}}

This lovely and light dessert is simple to make, with a texture that is more like that of a sorbet. To make it similar to the kind of ice cream you get in the west, you can use single or double cream instead of water and omit the lime or lemon juice. However, keep to this recipe for the true Thai style.

- Preparation time: 30 minutes
- Resting time: 4 hours
- Cooking time: 30 minutes
- Serves: 4 as a dessert

## Ingredients

- 115 g (4 oz) palm, coconut, brown sugar or honey
- 175 ml (6 fl oz) water
- 750 g (1 lb 10 oz) one large ripe mango or: two medium-sized mangoes
- zest and juice of 1 lime
- Ripe mango (Little tip: Choose a good mango that has a skin with no bruises or black dots. It should just be starting to turn yellow and have a lovely fragrance. It will continue to ripen in a warm temperature.)

## Let's get started!

1. Put the sugar and water in a saucepan and bring to boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the liquid reduces by half and let it cool. If you decide to use cream instead of water just gently warm with the sugar until the sugar has dissolved.

2. Clean and peel the mango (or mangoes) and cut the flesh off the stones, removing as much meat as you can. Avoid cutting very close to the seed where the meat is fibrous. It will make about 500 g (1 lb 2 oz) total in weight. Chop it into small pieces.

3. Put the mango, cool syrup, lime zest and juice in a food processor or blender and whiz until smooth. If you are using cream instead of water whiz in the same way.

4. Pour the mixture into a plastic container and freeze for 4 hours or until half-frozen. You should take it out and comb it with a fork at least once or twice during the freezer time. You want to have plenty of air whipped into it or it will be too icy and hard. Cover and keep well in the freezer for 3-4 months.

Remove the ice cream from the freezer for 5-10 minutes or until slightly softened. Scoop into the serving bowl.
