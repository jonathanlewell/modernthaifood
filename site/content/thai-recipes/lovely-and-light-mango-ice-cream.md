## A lovely and light dessert that is very simple to make.

This lovely and light dessert is simple to make, with a texture that is more like that of a sorbet. To make it similar to the kind of ice cream you get in the west, you can use single or double cream instead of water and omit the lime or lemon juice. However, keep to this recipe for the true Thai style.

- Thai name: "Ice cream mamuang"
- Preparation time: 30 minutes
- Resting time: 4 hours
- Cooking time: 30 minutes
- Serves: 4 as a dessert

## Ingredients

- 115 g (4 oz) palm, coconut, brown sugar or honey
- 175 ml (6 fl oz) water
- 750 g (1 lb 10 oz) one large ripe mango or: two medium-sized mangoes
- zest and juice of 1 lime

## Let's get started!

1. Put the sugar and water in a saucepan and bring to boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the liquid reduces by half and let it cool. If you decide to use cream instead of water just gently warm with the sugar until the sugar has dissolved.

2. Clean and peel the mango (or mangoes) and cut the flesh off the stones, removing as much meat as you can. Avoid cutting very close to the seed where the meat is fibrous. It will make about 500 g (1 lb 2 oz) total in weight. Chop it into small pieces.

3. Put the mango, cool syrup, lime zest and juice in a food processor or blender and whiz until smooth. If you are using cream instead of water whiz in the same way.

4. Pour the mixture into a plastic container and freeze for 4 hours or until half-frozen. You should take it out and comb it with a fork at least once or twice during the freezer time. You want to have plenty of air whipped into it or it will be too icy and hard. Cover and keep well in the freezer for 3-4 months.

5. Remove the ice cream from the freezer for 5-10 minutes or until slightly softened. Scoop into the serving bowl.

## Healthy tips

Mangoes are one of the best sources of beta-carotene, quercetin and astragalin, all of which are powerful antioxidants. Antioxidants neutralise the free radicals that can cause degenerative disease. Mangoes also contain vitamin K, phosphorus and magnesium, while being very rich in vitamins. 

One small mango provides two thirds of the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for vitamin A and a quarter of the RDA for vitamin C. Rich in potassium, which can help reduce the risk of high blood pressure, mangoes are also high in soluble dietary fibre.
