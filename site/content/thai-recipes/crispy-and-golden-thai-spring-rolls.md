## A quick introduction to Thai spring rolls

Also known as "Por pea thawt," these savoury roll packets are popular throughout Southeast Asia. The Thai version is a delicate cross between Chinese and Vietnamese styles. They are deep-fried to a light, golden brown and served crispy with sweet plum sauce or sweet chilli sauce. Spring rolls are great as a starter or as finger food.

- 2 tbsps plain (all purpose) flour
- 8 tbsps water
- 1½ tbsps sunflower oil
- 3-4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped
- 200 g (7 oz) fresh bean sprouts
- 55 g (2 oz) carrots, finely grated
- 55 g (2 oz) frozen green peas, defrosted
- 55 g (2 oz) frozen sweetcorn kernels, defrosted
- 1 cm (½ inch) fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated
- 1½-2 tbsps light soy sauce or 1-1½ tbsps fish sauce
- ¼ tsp ground white pepper
- 200 g (7 oz) 1 pack about 50 frozen spring roll sheets
- 13 x 13 cm (5 x 5 inches), defrosted
    sunflower oil for deep-frying
- You will also need: a tray

### Sweet Plum Sauce

- 200 ml (7 fl oz) white vinegar
- 175 g (6 oz) caster sugar
- 1 preserved plum without liquid (plums in brine are available in jars)
- Black fungus (dried version shown below) grows in frilly masses on dead wood. We use it for its chewy texture and powerful medicinal properties.

## Let's get started!

### The first step is to make the sweet plum sauce

1. Boil the vinegar and sugar in a small saucepan up to boiling point, stirring constantly. Reduce the heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes or until you get a thick syrup. Add a preserved plum and mash with a spoon or fork. Simmer for another 1-2 minutes and pour into a serving bowl. Step_1 (1)Step_1 (1)

2. Soak the mung bean vermicelli in hot water for 4-5 minutes or until soft. Drain well and cut them 4-5 times with a sharp knife to reduce their length.

3. Soak the black fungus in boiling water for 3-4 minutes or until soft, then drain. Remove and discard the hard stalks and roughly chop.

4. Mix the flour and water in a small saucepan until smooth. Stir and cook on a medium heat for 2-3 minutes or until thick, spoon the flour paste into a small bowl and set aside.

5. Heat 1½ tablespoons oil in a nonstick wok or frying pan and stir-fry the garlic on a medium heat for 1-2 minutes or until lightly browned.

    Add the vermicelli, dried fungus, bean sprouts, carrot, green peas, sweetcorn kernels, ginger, light soy sauce or fish sauce and ground white pepper.

    Cook for another 4-5 minutes, taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary and set aside. Allow the cooked filling to cool.Stir_Frying (1)

6. Place 2 spring roll sheets on a work surface. Keep all the remaining sheets in the plastic bag to prevent them drying out. Spoon 2 teaspoons of the filling along the side nearest to you about 2.5 cm (1 inch) from the edge. Bring the edge up, then roll it away from you a half turn over the filling.

    Fold the sides into the centre to enclose the filling.

    Then wrap and seal the join tightly with the flour paste and lay on a tray. Repeat with the rest of the filling and sheets.

### Spring rolls on tray, ready to deep-fry

7. Heat 5 cm (2 inches) oil in a wok or deep frying pan on a medium heat. When the oil seems ready to deep fry, drop in a small piece of spring roll sheet. If it sizzles immediately, the oil is ready.

    It is important not to have the oil too hot or the spring rolls will burn. Deep-fry them in batches for 6-8 minutes or until lightly browned and crispy.

    As the spring rolls cook, lift them out with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Repeat and continue to deep-fry in batches. Arrange the spring rolls on a platter. Serve hot or warm, with sweet plum sauce.

    *Note:* You can add 85 g (3 oz) minced (ground) prawn, chicken, turkey or pork after lightly browning the garlic. Crumble (whichever you have chosen) with a wooden spoon until separate and cooked. Add the vermicelli and follow as above with 115 g (4 oz) fresh bean sprouts.
