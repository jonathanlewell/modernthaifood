## A crunchy salad that is full of sweet, sour, hot and salty tastes.

This perfect crunchy Green Papaya Salad is wildly popular all over Thailand. Som means “sour,” while tam means “pound” with a pestle and mortar. It’s a crunchy tangle of pale green shreds of unripe papaya and is full of sweet, sour, hot and salty tastes. Multiply the ingredients by the number of portions but make just one serving at a time otherwise it won’t fit in your mortar.

You can make a version for strict vegetarians by omitting the dried shrimp and using light soy sauce instead of fish sauce. Green Papaya Salad is sometimes served with steamed sticky rice, which adds a satisfying helping of starch to the meal.

## The health benefits of Green Papaya

Green papaya (below) contains papain, an enzyme that has a soothing effect on the stomach and assists in protein digestion.

## Let's get started!

### Preparing the papaya

1) Make a start by chopping a half-inch off the end of the green papaya.

2) Peel the skin with a vegetable peeler. Being unripe the papaya has a tough skin, so you will need to be forceful. Mind your fingers! This is the traditional way of shredding green papaya, but the alternative method is easier: coarsely grate the papaya with a grater.

3) Holding the papaya in one hand, gently chop it to produce long shreds.

4) Slice off these shreds on to a tray or into a bowl and set aside.

5) In a small bowl (to the left of the garlic, below), mix the palm sugar with fish sauce or light soy sauce until the sugar has dissolved. Now you will have all the ingredients you need to make the salad. In the illustration, the palm sugar is the UFO-shaped object in the bowl with the peanuts.

### Making the salad

6) Using a wooden pestle and a large, deep, clay mortar, pound the garlic into a paste.

15) Lightly pound together for another minute until thoroughly mixed. As the juice comes out, pound more gently so the liquid doesn’t splash. Taste the sauce in the bottom of the mortar and adjust the seasoning if necessary. It should be a balance of sweet and sour with a hot and salty taste.
