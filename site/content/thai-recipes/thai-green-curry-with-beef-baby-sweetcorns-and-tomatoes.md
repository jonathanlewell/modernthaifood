## A Thai classic main course that's not too hot and full of taste

This classic dish should never be extremely hot. Its base is a paste of fresh small green chillies, galangal and lemon grass. Fresh baby sweetcorns add a light crunchiness, while the tomatoes add delightful colour.

You can use lamb, turkey or chicken fillets instead of beef if you prefer.

4) Add the remaining ingredients and pound until the mixture becomes a paste. Or: process all the ingredients in a food processor or blender.

5) Make more paste than you need and spoon each “quantity” (enough for one recipe) into a jar or double plastic bags. It will keep at least 2 weeks in the refrigerator or for 5-6 months in a freezer.

6) Heat the oil in a nonstick saucepan or wok and stir-fry the green curry paste on a medium heat for 3-4 minutes or until fragrant.

7) Add the beef and stir for 3-4 minutes.

Healthy Tip: Eaten in moderation, lean beef can be part of a healthy diet, according to nutritionists.

9) Add the tomatoes and kaffir lime leaves in the last few seconds, taking care not to let the tomatoes lose their shape.

10) Spoon into four serving bowls and garnish on top with Thai basil or coriander leaves and chilli.

## Variations - Lamb, turkey or chicken fillets

If you'd prefer a different kind of meat, you can. On most Thai restaurant menus you'll be presented with either chicken or beef - the two favourites. I'm going to add a recipe for this soon, but essentially the process is the same :)
