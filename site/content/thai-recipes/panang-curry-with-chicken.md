### Health Benefits!

The white meat of a chicken is lower in calories, lower in fat, and higher in protein than dark meat. Use free range or organic chicken for the best flavour.

Red chillies are known to reduce blood cholesterol, while increasing the body’s ability to dissolve fibrin, a substance integral to the formation of blood clots.

Garlic contains allicin, which has anti-fungal and antibiotic properties. It also has other compounds that have been shown to inactivate carcinogens and suppress the growth of tumours.

Galangal is just one of ten ingredients in this powerfully flavoured dry curry paste.

Use long fresh red chillies in the paste only if you cannot find dried ones.

## Ingredients
### Dry Curry Paste

- 2-3 dried red chillies about 13 cm (5 inches) longor: 2-3 fresh long red chillies, stemmed, de- seeded and roughly chopped
- 13 cm (5 inches) fresh lemon grass, finely sliced
- 2.5 cm (1 inch) fresh galangal, peeled and finely sliced
- 3 kaffir lime leaves, finely chopped
- 4 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped
- 3 shallots, peeled and roughly chopped
- 3-4 coriander roots and stalks, cleaned and roughly chopped
- 1 tsp shrimp paste (optional)
- 1 tsp ground cumin or 25 g (1 oz) packet of dry curry paste

### Main Dish

- 25 g (1 oz) dried tamarind pulp (about 1 tbsp) or: instead of tamarind, 2½ tbsps lime or lemon juice
- 1½-2 tbsps sunflower oil
- 600 g (1 lb 5 oz) chicken fillets, finely sliced
- 200 ml (7 fl oz) ½ tin coconut milk (reserve 3 tbsps for garnish)
- ½ tsp plain (all purpose) flour
- 1-1½ tbsps fish sauce
- 1½ oz (35 g) palm, coconut or brown sugar

### Garnish

- 3-4 kaffir lime leaves, finely shredded
- a few slices of fresh red chilli

## Let's get started!

1. If you are using dried chillies, soak them in boiling hot water for 4-5 minutes or until soft, then drain.

2. Using a pestle and mortar, pound the chillies you are using (dried & soaked, or fresh), the lemon grass and galangal into a paste. Add the remaining ingredients and pound the mixture until it again becomes a paste.

  Or: process all the ingredients in a food processor or blender into a paste.

  Make more paste than you need and spoon each “quantity” (enough for one recipe) into a jar or double plastic bags. It will keep at least 2 weeks in the refrigerator or for 5-6 months in a freezer.

3. In a small bowl soak the tamarind pulp with the boiling water for 4-5 minutes. Mash with a spoon or fork to help it dissolve. Then strain the thick liquid into a small bowl and reserve the fibres in another bowl. These are useful if you need to strain the liquid again.

4. Heat the oil in a nonstick saucepan or wok and stir-fry the dry curry paste on a medium heat for 3-4 minutes or until fragrant.

5. Add the chicken, stirring for 4-5 minutes. Add coconut milk, fish sauce, sugar, and 3 tablespoons of tamarind purée, lime or lemon juice and reduce to a low heat. Simmer uncovered for about 5-7 minutes. This is meant to be a dry curry, not too hot, with a sweet and sour taste. (You can add a little more water during the cooking if it is drying out too much). Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.

6. Mix a half teaspoon of flour and the reserved coconut milk in a small saucepan until smooth. Stir and cook on a medium heat for 2-3 minutes or until thick.
Spoon the panaeng curry into four serving bowls and spoon on top with coconut cream. Sprinkle kaffir lime leaves and chilli.
