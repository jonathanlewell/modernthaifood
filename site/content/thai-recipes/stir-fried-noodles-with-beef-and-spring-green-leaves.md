## "Phat kuaytiaw raat naa neua lai pak"

The original version of this dish uses bitter vegetables such as Chinese kale (kai lan) but I’ve chosen spring green leaves because they’re more generally available. You may not find it easy to wilt the leaves quickly so it could be easier to cook half the ingredients at a time, then repeat the process.

## The health benefits!

Eaten in moderation, lean beef can be part of a healthy diet. It is a good source of high quality protein, iron, zinc and B vitamins.

- ½ tbsp light soy sauce or dark soy sauce for darker colour

### Other Ingredients

- 4 dried shiitake mushrooms or button mushrooms
- 600 ml (1 pint) beef or vegetable stock
- 2 tbsps oyster sauce
- 3 tbsps light soy sauce
- 1 tsp sugar (optional)
- 1-1½ tbsps black bean sauce or salted soybeans
- 2 tbsps cornflour
- 350 g (12 oz) spring green leaves (clean and thinly slice the stalks, roughly chop the top leaves, and separate)

## Let's get started!

To make this dish: cook the noodles separately before spooning over the beef and spring green leaves. Each portion should have plenty of slightly thick sauce on it for you to mix with the noodles during the meal.

1. Soak the noodles in boiling water or cook them according to the manufacturer’s instructions until they start to get tender but not completely soft. Drain, then add a bowl of water to make the noodles cool down, then drain again. (If the noodles are completely soft they will easily break up during stir-frying.) If you like to use ready cooked noodles you can use them straight from the packet.

2. Drizzle over with the oil and light or dark soy sauce and toss together with your fingers. The oil will make the noodles stay separate.

3. Put the shiitake mushrooms in a small bowl and pour boiling water over them until they are just covered. Soak for 5 minutes or until soft, then drain and save the soaking liquid. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve to get rid of any sand and mix with the stock to make about 600 ml (1 pint). Roughly slice the mushrooms.

4. Mix stock, oyster sauce, light soy sauce, sugar, black bean sauce or salted soybeans, and cornflour in a bowl.

5. Blanch the stalks in boiling water for 1 minute. Remove and place in a bowl of cold water or running water to ensure a crispy texture, drain.

6. Stir-fry the noodles in a nonstick wok or frying pan for 3-4 minutes or until they are cooked and softened. You will find the noodles begin to stick together. Keep them warm.

7. Heat the oil into a nonstick wok or frying pan and stir-fry the garlic on a medium heat for 1-2 minutes or until lightly browned. Add the beef and the stalks of the vegetables you are using and stir-fry for 3-4 minutes. Add the top leaves and stir-fry for another 3-4 minutes. Stir the sauce mixture and add it to the pan, then stir-fry for another 1-2 minutes or so. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.

8. Divide the warm noodles on to each serving plate. Spoon the beef, spring green leaves and sauce over them, and sprinkle with white pepper.
