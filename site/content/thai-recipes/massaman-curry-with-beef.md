### Garnish

## Let's get started!

1. If you are using dried chillies, soak them in boiling water for 4-5 minutes or until soft, then drain.

2. Using a pestle and mortar, grind or pound the chillies you are using (dried & soaked, or fresh), the lemon grass and galangal into a paste. Add the remaining ingredients and pound the mixture until it again becomes a paste.

    Or: process all the ingredients in a food processor or blender into a paste.

    Make more paste than you need and spoon each “quantity” (enough for one recipe) into a jar or double plastic bags. It will keep at least 2 weeks in the refrigerator or for 5-6 months in a freezer.

3. In a small bowl soak the tamarind pulp with the boiling water for 4-5 minutes. Mash with a spoon or fork to help it dissolve. Then strain the thick liquid into a small bowl and reserve the fibres in another bowl. These are useful if you need to strain the liquid again.

4. Dry-fry the cinnamon stick, star anise, cardamon seeds and cloves in a nonstick saucepan or wok over a low heat. Moving all the ingredients around for 4-5 minutes or until fragrant. Remove from the pan. Or: grill for 1-2 minutes each side or until fragrant.

5. Heat the oil in the same saucepan or wok and stir-fry the massaman paste over a medium heat for 3-4 minutes or until fragrant.

6. Add the beef to the pan and stir for 4-5 minutes. Add coconut milk, stock, onions, fish sauce, sugar, 3 tablespoons of tamarind purée, lime or lemon juice, dry-fried spices and peanuts. Bring up to the boiling point, turn the heat to low, then cover, leaving a small gap between the lid and the side of the saucepan, and simmer for 45 minutes-1 hour or until the beef is soft and tender.

    Stir occasionally. Add the cooked potatoes and warm through for 2-3 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Or, if you have reduced the sauce too much, add a little stock or water.

7. Spoon into serving bowls and garnish with the chilli.
