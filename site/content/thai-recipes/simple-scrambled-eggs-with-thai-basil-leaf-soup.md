## Ingredients

### Main Dish

- 400 g (14 oz) chicken fillets
- 4 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped
- 4 coriander roots and stalks, cleaned and roughly chopped
- ¼ tsp salt
- ¼ tsp ground white pepper
- 2-2½ tbsps sunflower oil
- 4 large fresh eggs, beaten with a pinch of ground white pepper
- 1.7 litres (3 pints) chicken or vegetable stock
- 3 tbsps light soy sauce
- 2 handfuls fresh Thai basil leaves

Thai basil is distinguished by its purple stems and subtle aniseed taste.

## Let's get started!

1. Finely slice 200 g (7 oz) chicken fillets, place in a bowl and set aside. Mince or grind 200 g (7 oz) chicken in a small blender.

2. Using a pestle and mortar or small blender, grind the garlic and coriander roots into a paste. (Or: fine chop them and press backwards and forwards with the flat side of a knife until to make the paste.)

3. Mix the minced chicken with the garlic and coriander paste, salt and ground white pepper.

4. Heat the oil in a nonstick pan. Pour the beaten eggs into it and scramble them for 3-4 minutes. Remove the scrambled eggs from the pan and set aside.

5. Heat the stock in the saucepan to boiling point. Reduce the heat to low, then add light soy sauce and fish sauce. Use a spoon or your wet fingers to shape the chicken mixture into small balls and drop them into the stock. Add the sliced chicken and cook for 4-5 minutes or until the minced chicken balls are floating up and cooked.

6. Add the scrambled eggs and Thai basil leaves and just warm through for 2-3 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Spoon into each serving bowl.

7. You can garnish with a slice or two of chilli if you want to offer the option of a hotter taste.
