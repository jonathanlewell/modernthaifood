- 3 shallots, peeled and roughly chopped
- 3 coriander roots and stalks, roughly chopped

- ¼ tsp ground pepper or: 25 g (1 oz) packet of green curry paste

### Main Dish

- 1½-2 tbsps sunflower oil
- 450 g (1 lb) lean sirloin, rump or fillet steak, finely sliced
- 400 ml (14 fl oz) 1 tin coconut milk
- 50 ml (2 fl oz) beef, vegetable stock or water (about 3 tbsps)
- 2½-3 tbsps fish sauce
- 25-35 g (1-1½ oz) palm, coconut or brown sugar
- 140 g (5 oz) baby sweetcorns, left whole or cut in half diagonally

## Let's get started!

### Making the green curry paste

1. Using a pestle and mortar, grind or pound one of the chillies, the lemon grass, galangal and kaffir lime leaves into a paste.

2. Add garlic, shallots and coriander roots and pound again.

3. Add the coriander leaves and basil leaves. More pounding!

4. Add the remaining ingredients and pound until the mixture becomes a paste. Or: process all the ingredients in a food processor or blender.

5. Make more paste than you need and spoon each “quantity” (enough for one recipe) into a jar or double plastic bags. It will keep at least 2 weeks in the refrigerator or for 5-6 months in a freezer.

6. Heat the oil in a nonstick saucepan or wok and stir-fry the green curry paste on a medium heat for 3-4 minutes or until fragrant. Add the beef and stir for 3-4 minutes.

7. Add the coconut milk, stock, fish sauce and sugar and cook for about 4-5 minutes.

8. Add the baby sweetcorns and cook for another 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.

Healthy Tip: Eaten in moderation, lean beef can be part of a healthy diet, according to nutritionists.

9. Add the tomatoes and kaffir lime leaves in the last few seconds, taking care not to let the tomatoes lose their shape.

10. Spoon into four serving bowls and garnish on top with Thai basil or coriander leaves and chilli.
