## Thai cooking classes in Colchester

 If you're serious about learning to cook Thai food, come to a cooking class in the lovely town of Colchester, Essex, UK.

I teach these classes regularly every month. Bring an apron and get ready for some hands-on participation.

Learn to cook a delicious Thai starter, a substantial main course, perfect jasmine rice, and a scrumptious Thai dessert.
