## Easy to find!
It's just a ten-minute walk from the station, so why not come by train? Colchester is fifty minutes from London Liverpool Street.

## Between the station and the town centre...
- Whether you live locally or are coming from London, it's easy to get here.
- Colchester is one of England's most attractive towns: for shopping and sightseeing.
- Enjoy your Thai meal in Parkside Quarter, overlooking the beautiful River Colne.

### Near Castle Park
If you're coming with friends who are not attending the class, there's plenty for them to see and do in Colchester.

It is Britain's oldest recorded town, with Roman walls and gates, and the remains of an amphitheatre and a circus.

The Norman castle (above), set in one of the finest parks in England, was built on the site of the Temple of Claudius, the Roman Emperor/God.

### Down by the river
If you're coming by car, the nearest car park is just on the south side of St. Peter's Street, a two-minute walk away.

Colchester is on the A12, eighteen miles south of Ipswich, Suffolk, or about a thirty-minute drive.

Rush hour traffic has dispersed by the time visitors to my cooking classes arrive for the 10.30am start.

### You Found it!
If you came to one of my previous classes that I used to teach in Framlingham, I'd love to see you again, here in Colchester.

My house is brown on one side, white on other. You can't miss it! Come to the front door on the white side, facing the river.

We'll cook a lovely meal together and you'll get to meet other people with a similar interest in learning how to cook Thai food.
