A Thai cooking class makes a delightful and unusual gift. I offer a range of high quality gift cards (like the ones below), each of which contains a numbered voucher, plus all the menus for the coming year. All you have to do is to fill in the "to/from," pop it in the envelope, and give it to the lucky recipient.

*Please note:* If you'd like to buy a card for Christmas, please ensure your order reaches us before December 7. We cannot guarantee delivery in time for Christmas if it's any later!

The gift cards are in the "East Anglian Landscape" series, which normally retail in galleries for Â£3.95.

Shown above (top) "Snape, at Dawn" and (below) "Orford Castle, Against the Light."

These cards are also available for purchase without the vouchers, for use as normal gift cards, at the gallery price.

All the photographs (like those on this site) are by John Lewell, author "The Digital Photographer's Software Guide" (Cengage, 2009) and "Digital Photography for Next to Nothing" (Wiley, 2010).
