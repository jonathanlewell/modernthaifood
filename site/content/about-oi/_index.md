Hi everyone!

You've probably seen my books in the bookstores. Now you can buy my new e-books right here online.

In Thai, "Oi" means "sweet, like sugar cane." My surname is a little harder to say. Cheep - Chai - ISSara. (There, once you break it up into three little pieces, it's not so bad!)

I was born in the south and studied at the Poh-Chang Institute in Bangkok. I've lived in England for 20 years, hence the British spelling in my e-books.

My dearest wish is to pass on my knowledge of Thai cooking so you can enjoy eating Thai food you've prepared in your own home.
