# About Thai Food Secrets

I've written these sixteen e-books to help you prepare Thai food at home for your family and friends.

They are highly detailed, with hundreds of step-by-step illustrations; preparation and cooking times; alternative ingredient suggestions; plus health tips for every recipe.

**If you get them all you'll have a complete encyclopedia of Thai cooking.**

After purchase, you can download them immediately as a .PDF and read them on your phone, tablet or computer.

## Quality guarantee

I've cooked every recipe many times, making adjustments to quantities so that you get the most accurate, triple-checked instructions.

If you want to avoid the potential disappointment of using untested recipes from the Internet, you'll never regret buying these low-cost e-books. They will give you hours of enjoyment and help you cook dozens of delicious meals.

Please take a look at what's on offer on this page. Mouth-watering, yes?
